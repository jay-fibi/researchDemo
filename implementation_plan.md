# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a console-based Snake game in Java where the player controls a snake that grows by eating food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. The game will run in the terminal with text-based graphics, using keyboard input for direction control and displaying the game board, score, and game over messages.

The implementation will create a standalone Java application that can be run from the command line. It will use standard Java libraries (Scanner for input, Random for food placement, Thread for game timing) without external dependencies. The game will feature a simple grid-based board, real-time movement, scoring system, and basic collision detection.

## Types
Define core data structures and enums for the Snake game implementation.

- **Direction enum**: Represents movement directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) with integer values for row/column changes.
- **Point class**: Represents coordinates on the game board with x and y integer fields, equals() and hashCode() methods for comparison.
- **Snake class**: Contains a List<Point> for snake segments, methods to add/remove segments, get head position, check self-collision.
- **Food class**: Contains a Point for food location, method to generate random position.
- **GameBoard class**: 2D char array representing the board, methods to initialize, update with snake/food positions, render to console.

## Files
Create a new Java source file for the complete game implementation.

- **New files to be created**:
  - SnakeGame.java (main game file with all classes and game logic)
- **Existing files to be modified**: None
- **Files to be deleted or moved**: None
- **Configuration file updates**: None

## Functions
Implement core game functions within the SnakeGame class.

- **New functions**:
  - main(String[] args): Entry point, initializes game and starts game loop
  - initializeGame(): Sets up initial snake position, food, score, direction
  - gameLoop(): Main loop handling input, movement, collision checks, rendering
  - handleInput(): Reads keyboard input to change direction
  - moveSnake(): Updates snake position based on current direction
  - checkCollisions(): Verifies wall and self-collision, ends game if detected
  - generateFood(): Places food at random empty position
  - renderBoard(): Prints current game board to console
  - displayScore(): Shows current score and game status
- **Modified functions**: None
- **Removed functions**: None

## Classes
Define classes for game components and main game controller.

- **New classes**:
  - Direction (enum): Defines movement directions
  - Point: Represents 2D coordinates
  - Snake: Manages snake segments and movement
  - Food: Handles food placement
  - GameBoard: Manages game grid display
  - SnakeGame: Main class containing game logic and loop
- **Modified classes**: None
- **Removed classes**: None

## Dependencies
No external dependencies required - uses only standard Java libraries.

- New packages: None
- Version changes: None
- Integration requirements: None

## Testing
Implement basic testing for core game mechanics.

- Unit tests for collision detection logic
- Manual testing for gameplay flow, input handling, scoring
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions and game over scenarios
- Test file: SnakeGameTest.java (optional JUnit tests)

## Implementation Order
Follow this sequence to build the game incrementally:

1. Create SnakeGame.java with basic structure and Direction enum
2. Implement Point class with coordinate handling
3. Add Snake class with segment management
4. Implement Food class with random placement
5. Create GameBoard class for grid display
6. Add game initialization and basic rendering
7. Implement snake movement and direction changes
8. Add food consumption and scoring
9. Implement collision detection for walls and self
10. Integrate input handling and game loop timing
11. Add game over logic and restart functionality
12. Test and refine gameplay mechanics
